	<h1>Image</h1>
	<p>Images make the website attractive in cases. There are background images that we have already discussed in the Body section. What comes next is to set a standalone image. In HTML we can do this task by using the &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
	<p>The tag is followed by some attributes as listed below:- 
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>src: This specifies the path of the image that has to be displayed. It could be an https:// link or a direct image from the local file system.</li>
			<li>width: Specifies the width of the Image.</li>
			<li>Height: Specifies the height of the Image.</li>
			<li>alt: This contains text within it which will be displayed in case there is a error in loading the Image.</li>
		</ul></p>
<div class="next">
	<button><a href="Media.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;NEXT&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></button>

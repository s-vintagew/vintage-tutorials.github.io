<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>Comments are the most valuable source of information for developers. They have no work in the users end. Comments are not displayed in the Web-page, these are lines or statements written as a message from one developer to point out which section of code is for what purpose. Comments help out when a larger code has to be debugged and they pinpoint to the specific area of the code.</p>
<p>In HTML comments are written as <br>&lt;!--desired comment--&gt;</p>

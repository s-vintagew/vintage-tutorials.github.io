	<h1>Media</h1>
	<p>Often in websites we need to add media, i.e., Audio and Video. This can be achieved by making use of &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags.</p>
	<p>The attributes are same for both the tags.
		<ul type="square">
			<li>autoplay: With no value in it, this attribute automatically starts the video/audio as soon as the media is loaded in the browser.</li>
			<li>controls: This attribute specifies whether there would be any controls to play/pause etc, with the media.</li>
			<li>loop: As the name suggests this can be used to set the audio to loop.</li>
			<li>src: This is the most important attribute and one that makes the tag valid. It contains the path to the desired media (online/offline).</li>
		</ul></p>

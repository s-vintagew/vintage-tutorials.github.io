	<h1>Operators</h1>
	<p>Operators are used to perform operation on one, two or more operands. Operator is represented by a symbol such as +, =, *, % etc. Following are the operators supported by JavaScript −
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Arithmetic Operators </li>
			<li>Comparison Operators</li> 
			<li>Logical (or Relational) Operators </li>
			<li>Assignment Operators </li>
			<li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators </li>
			<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>		
		</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th id="col">Operator</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">+</td>
			<td>Add two Operands</td>
			<td>10+10 will give 20</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">-</td>
			<td>Subtract second operand from the first.</td>
			<td>10 – 10 will give 0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">* </td>
			<td>Multiply two operands. </td>
			<td>10 * 30 will give 300</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">/ </td>
			<td>Divide numerator by denominator </td>
			<td>10/10 will give 1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">% </td>
			<td>It is called modulus operator and gives remainder of the  division.</td>
			<td>10 % 10 will give 0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">++ </td>
			<td>Increment operator, increases integer value by one </td>
			<td>10 ++ will give 11</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">-- </td>
			<td>Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one </td>
			<td>10 – will give 9</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th id="col">Operator</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">== </td>
			<td>Checks if values of two operands are equal or not, If yes then  condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>10 == 10 will give true</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">!= </td>
			<td>Not Equal to operator
				Checks if the value of two operands is equal or not, if values  are not equal then condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>10 !=10 will give false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">&gt;</td>
			<td>Greater Than operator 
				Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>20 > 10 will give true</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">&lt;</td>
			<td>Less than operator 
				Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of  right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>10 < 20 will give true</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">&gt;= </td>
			<td>Greater than or equal to operator 
				Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to  the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>10 >=20 will give false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">&lt;= </td>
			<td>Less than or equal to operator 
				Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the  value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
			<td>10 <=20 will give true.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th id="col">Operator</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">&& </td>
			<td>Logical AND operator  returns true if both  operands are non zero.</td>
			<td>10 && 10 will give true.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">|| </td>
			<td>Logical OR operator  returns true If any of  the operand is non zero</td>
			<td>10 || 0 will give true.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">! </td>
			<td>Logical NOT operator  complements the logical state of its operand.</td>
			<td>! (10 && 10) will give  false.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th id="col">Operator</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">= </td>
			<td>Simple Assignment operator<br>
				Assigns values from right side operands to left side  operand.</td>
			<td>C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">+= </td>
			<td>Add AND assignment operator <br>
				It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
			<td>C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">-= </td>
			<td>Subtract AND assignment operator 
				It subtracts right operand from the left operand and  assign the result to left operand</td>
			<td>C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">*= </td>
			<td>Multiply AND assignment operator 
				It multiplies right operand with the left operand and  assign the result to left operand</td>
			<td>C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">/= </td>
			<td>Divide AND assignment operator 
				It divides left operand with the right operand and  assign the result to left operand</td>
			<td>C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">%= </td>
			<td>Modulus AND assignment operator
				Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus  using two operands and assign the result to left  operand</td>
			<td>C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<h2>Conditional Operator</h2>
	<p>It is also called a Ternary Operator as it has three operands</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th id="col">Operator</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="col">?:</td>
			<td>Conditional Expression</td>
			<td>If Condition is true? Then  value X : Otherwise value Y</td>
		</tr>

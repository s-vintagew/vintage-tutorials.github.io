	<h1>Variables</h1>
	<p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>JavaScript application needs to work with information. <br>Here are two examples: <br>An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.<br>A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.<br>Variables are used to store this information.</li>
			<li>A variable is a “named storage” for data. </li>
			<li>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
			<br>let message;
			<br>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:
			<br>message = 'Hello'; // store the string
			<br>To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line: 
			let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value <br> 
			alert(message); // Hello!</li>
			<li>We can also declare multiple variables in one line: let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello'; </li>
			<li>Also you can define multiple variables in this multiline style: let user = 'John',  age = 25, message = 'Hello';</li> 
			<li>In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let: var message = 'Hello';</li>
			<li>Declaring twice triggers an error </li>
			<li>A variable should be declared only once. </li>
			<li>A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:
			<br>let message = "This";// repeated 'let' leads to an error
			<br>let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared <br>So, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without let.</li>
		</ul>

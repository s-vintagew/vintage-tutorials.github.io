	<h2>Why do we need JavaScript? </h2>
	<p>JavaScript is the programming language of the internet. You see JavaScript (Js for short) all over  the internet. There are three languages every programmer at every web development speaks â€“ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. HTML tells a browser what content to show on your web pages. CSS tells the browser how to lay the content out and format it to look great. JavaScript controls the behavior of the page. All the pop-ups, cool transitions, scrolling animations, and other attractive aspects of modern websites are created using JavaScript.</p>

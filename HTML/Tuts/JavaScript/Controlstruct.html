	<h1>Control Structures</h1>
	<p>A control structure, as the term implies, refers to the flow of execution of the program. There are two possible control structures: <em>linear</em> and<em> non-linear</em>.</p>
	<p>The linear execution (also called sequential execution) refers to the execution of the statements in the order they are listed. In comparison, the non-linear execution refers to the execution of statements regardless of the order they are listed.</p>
	<p>There are three ways to change the control structures of a program by using: 
	<ul>
		<li>conditional statements (also called conditional logic) </li>
		<li>looping control </li>
		<li>branch logic</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Control structure actually controls the flow of execution of a program. Following  are the several control structure supported by JavaScript. 
		<ul>
			<li>if â€¦ else </li>
			<li>switch case </li>
			<li>do while loop </li>
			<li>while loop </li>
			<li>for loop</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

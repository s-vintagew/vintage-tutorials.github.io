	<h1>How Does JavaScript Improve Your Site?</h1>
	<p>Client-side programming: It’s one of the few languages that isn’t run on the server that hosts  the web page. If you’re a web developer, the time taken to load a page on a viewer’s browser  must be as low as possible. The higher the load time, the lower the user experience.</p>
	<p>Small learning curve: JavaScript isn’t the only programming language for the web. Others  include Python, C++, and a few more. However, it’s the most popular because it’s easy to learn. The syntax JavaScript uses is very similar to English.</p>
	<p>Compatible with other languages: Web servers use different languages to run well. Python, PHP, Ruby,  Rails, ASP.NET, and Java are a few examples. Regardless of the language used on the server, your viewers will always have a rich, responsive  experience because JavaScript works well with all of these languages.</p>
	<p>Compiler-free programming: Traditional coding uses a compiler. A browser uses a compiler to  translate raw code into readable syntax. This takes time and increases the load time of the page. It also  increases the amount of time your site will be in development. On the other hand, browsers can natively read JavaScript. They can translate it the same way they do  HTML. A compiler isn’t needed to make it readable.</p>

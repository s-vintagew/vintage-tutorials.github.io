		<p>Consisting of various elements and their attributes along with styles (CSS which is in the later part of the tutorial) and some real time events makes it fun for developing websites.</p>
		<p>But unlike other Programming Languages HTML doesn't have a fixed compiler. It totally depends on the browser for parsing depending on which HTML Version it supports. Now this compiler factor is very annoying at times because you won't even know that you made a mistake somewhere in the code unless you see the output and this becomes hectic when the Code is huge enough. But there's thrill in that I must say.</p>
		<p>There are 3 languages which a Web-Developer must learn
			<ol type="1">
				<li>HTML: for defining the content/structure of the Web-page</li>
				<li>CSS: for specifying the layout/design of Web-page</li>
				<li>JavaScript: for programming the behavior of the Web-page</li>
			</ol></p>
		<p>To begin with Web Designing we learn HTML which provides the layout of the Web-page or you can say Website(a collection of web-pages). This is the foundation/blue-print/base of any particular website no matter how good and attractive and appealing it looks. </p>
		<p><em>HTML</em> stand for Hyper Text Markup Language, and as said earlier provides the basic structure of any web-page.</p>
		<p>After HTML we have CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheet which is used for providing designs and styles to the Web-page. And following this we have Java-script that is used for the back-end calculations etc.</p>

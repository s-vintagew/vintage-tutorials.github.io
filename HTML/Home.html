    <p id="h">Welcome Web Enthusiasts</p>
	<p>You are Welcome to Vintage Wizard Tutorials. Throughout the web you may find a lot many websites listed for HTML & CSS & JavaScript but over here we go for the basics only. If the basics are clear and thorough enough then we can always go for Higher & more Advanced Programming or Web Building.</p>
	<p>Here you will hardly find any videos. Because learning through videos I feel will make you feel bored and moreover there won't be any sure & determined hardwork from your side.</p>
	<p>Here you can have a quick go through on all the HTML Basics, CSS Basics and JS Basics. Keep Experimenting and Happy Learning. Many a times it is obsered that HTML is taken as a light and easy programming language but we'd like to make you sure of that HTML is not at all a easy and quick learning tool. HTML along with CSS and JS needs proper dedication and also some hardwork just to achieve basic and accurate knowledge about the HTML Tags.</p>
    <p>Below is a image of a Registration Form which looks so simple yet elegant.<br><img id="i" src="HTML Demo.png"><br>Now this image is shown because this thing can be easily structured by table tags of HTML and few other complexities but basics,  whereas the CSS involved in this crosses more than 2000 lines of code. Also for Validation of the Form Inputs, JS has to added which will verify every input. And this is why one must be consistent towards hardworking to master Web Developing and <samp id="p">basic comes first</samp>.</p>

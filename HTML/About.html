	<h1>My Story So Far</h1>
	<p>Back in December 2020 I was beginning to learn HTML and CSS taught by our teachers in our college. For experimenting I was keen to make a website of my own adding as many elements as possible and complete the website with whatever is taught to us. At the same time I also sensed that across the globe there are less websites dealing with only the basics of Website designing and building so it came to my mind that I could attempt to make a website which just gives basic info and examples of 1st year HTML Course.</p>
	<p>Therefore, this website was designed for those enthusiasts who would only like to learn the Basics. I will also list a number of good sites available across the globe for higher and advanced learning of Website Design and you can after completion of the topics of this site head over there for better understanding and learning.</p>
	<h1>About the Name</h1>
	<p>Well honestly saying this name isn't my thought. It was back in 2017 or I guess 2018 when I first got an android and the trend was COC(Clash of Clans) and for that we needed to create a Google Play Account. And fortunately I got the name Vintage Wizard which I liked so much that it became the pen name of my. I use it everywhere starting from my social media handles to games to website name. So this is where the Website name came from.</p>
	<h1>About the Author</h1>
	<img src="IMG-20181008-WA0001.jpg" width="300px">
	<p>I am Souhardya Sarkar, a student of Institute of Computer Technology, Ganpat University almost throught the 1st Sem. Well if you are into coding or tech then generally what our hobbies are is Tech News, games, rides and travelling and being with nature most of the time. I myself have the same hobbies. Cycling is my favourite, it keeps my body in perfect shape also and at the same time I love to travel to different places knowing their culture, tradition etc. and try to learn something beneficial from them. Remember if you are a tech freak or interested in Cyber Security like me first thing I feel we should have is keen observation of collecting information.</p>
    <h1>About the Team</h1>
    <p>The Team comprises of we three members. Namely- Atharv, Bhavin and Souhardya. We met each other during the mid of First Sem and our interests and efforts sort of match and so we decided that in our project we will work individually yet as a team for gathering resources, etc. And in such a way friendship grew and here we are creating our own websites.</p>
	<h1>About the Site</h1>
	<p>As far as the website is concerned, I am a new learner and do forgive me for any misleads though there shouldn't be any. Also if you find any then feel free to give the feedback or write an email to me. Hope you enjoy(ed) the topics and other things in the website. Looking for your feedback.</p>
